# DioramaProject_1

Hello!

The purpose of this repo is to publish the code I use in my diorama project. 

This diorama project models the video clip of the song Around the World by Daft Punk (1997). 
The code is for Arduino Nano and I programmed the LED blinks based on the beat patterns used in the song. 

The color of the LEDs in the script is to group the dancers. It is easier for me to see the movement in the blinks while I'm working on the breadboard. Each dancer group also represents a beat line used in the song (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_(Daft_Punk_song)#Music_video).

In this project we defined the groups as:
Skeletons are the guitar, blue color.
Mummies are the bass, red color. 
Synchronised swimmers are the high pitch sounds, green color.
Robots are the vocals, yellow color. 

I asked ChatGPT the beat patterns. It looks fine and in sync.
